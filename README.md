The script analyzes the effect of Treatment 2 across different political groups using two dependent variables:

Agreement with the statement: "Immigrants can contribute to Italy’s economic growth."

Agreement with the statement: "Assisting migrants is a national duty."

The independent variables include:

Political Orientation (Scale 0-10)

Treatment 2 Exposure (Binary: 1 for Treatment 2)

Interaction Term (Political Orientation × Treatment 2)

Output & Interpretation

Each script provides:

Regression Results from statsmodels:

R² (coefficient of determination)

Regression coefficients

Statistical significance (p-values)

Key Findings:

The interaction term assesses whether Treatment 2 impacts respondents differently based on their political orientation.

Significant results suggest that political ideology influences the messenger effect.
